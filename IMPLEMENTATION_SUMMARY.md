# Implementation Summary: Military Unit Recruitment and Maintenance System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete military unit recruitment and maintenance cost system for "Patria Grande: Independencia Sudamericana" following the specifications in the problem statement.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Documentation (docs/CostosUnidades.md)
- Comprehensive cost tables for all military units
- Detailed breakdown of recruitment vs maintenance costs
- Implementation notes and balance considerations
- All required resources documented

### 2. Data Structure Updates (Scripts/Data/UnitData.gd)
- Added `costos_reclutamiento` for one-time recruitment costs
- Added `costos_mantenimiento` for per-turn maintenance costs  
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `consumo` field
- Supports all 11 required resource types

### 3. Unit Data Files Updated
**Infantry Units:**
- PelotÃ³n (50 men): Pan 100â†’10, Carne 50â†’5, weapons, cultural resources
- CompaÃ±Ã­a (150 men): Scaled costs for larger unit
- BatallÃ³n (450 men): Battalion-level costs
- Regimiento (1350 men): Regiment-level costs

**Cavalry Units:**
- EscuadrÃ³n (30 men): Includes horses for mobility
- CompaÃ±Ã­a (90 men): Company-level cavalry 
- Regimiento (270 men): Full cavalry regiment

**Artillery Units:**
- BaterÃ­a PequeÃ±a (30 men): 2 cannons, support horses
- BaterÃ­a Mediana (60 men): 4 cannons, more ammunition
- BaterÃ­a Grande (90 men): 6 cannons, full artillery battery

### 4. Recruitment Management System (Scripts/Manager/RecruitmentManager.gd)
- Complete recruitment validation and resource deduction
- Automatic maintenance cost processing per turn
- City-based unit availability based on settlement size
- Resource balance checking and penalty system
- Integration with existing game architecture

### 5. UI Integration (Scripts/UI/MainHUD.gd)
- Recruitment panel accessible from city selection
- Real-time cost display and resource availability checking
- Visual feedback for successful/failed recruitment
- Automatic maintenance processing each turn
- Event logging for all recruitment and maintenance activities

### 6. Game Integration (project.godot)
- RecruitmentManager added to autoload for global access
- Seamless integration with existing game systems
- Automatic initialization and setup

## âœ… Resources Implementation Verification

All 11 required resources are properly implemented:

**Food Resources:**
- Pan (bread) - Used by all units for basic sustenance
- Carne (meat) - Protein for maintaining unit strength

**Military Resources:**
- Sables - Melee weapons for infantry and cavalry
- Mosquetes - Firearms for infantry units  
- MuniciÃ³n - Ammunition for all ranged units and artillery
- Caballos - Horses for cavalry mobility and artillery transport
- CaÃ±ones - Artillery pieces for siege and battlefield support

**Cultural/Religious Resources:**
- Vino - Wine for morale and celebrations
- Aguardiente - Strong liquor for unit cohesion
- Tabaco - Tobacco for traditions and stress relief
- Biblias - Religious texts for spiritual support

## âœ… Game Balance Features

### City-Based Recruitment
- **Small settlements**: Can only recruit basic units (PelotÃ³n, EscuadrÃ³n, BaterÃ­a PequeÃ±a)
- **Medium cities**: Can recruit company-level units
- **Large cities**: Can recruit battalion-level units  
- **Capitals**: Can recruit all unit types including regiments

### Economic Balance
- Recruitment costs scale with unit size and complexity
- Maintenance costs are proportional to unit capabilities
- Resource consumption balanced with city production capacity
- Cultural resources required for maintaining high morale

### Strategic Depth
- Units without proper maintenance suffer morale penalties and desertion
- Resource scarcity creates strategic decision points
- Different unit types have different resource profiles
- Supply lines become important for large armies

## âœ… Technical Implementation

### Code Quality
- Clean, documented GDScript following Godot conventions
- Minimal changes to existing codebase
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Error handling and validation throughout

### Performance
- Efficient resource calculations
- Minimal memory footprint
- Scales well with increasing numbers of units and cities

### Maintainability  
- Modular design allows easy cost adjustments
- Centralized resource definitions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensive logging for debugging

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

### Recruiting a Unit
1. Select a city from the city list
2. Click "Reclutar Unidades" button
3. Choose desired unit type (if resources available)
4. Confirm recruitment - resources automatically deducted
5. Unit appears on map at city location

### Maintenance Processing
- Automatically occurs each turn when "Next Turn" is pressed
- Shows resource consumption summary in event log
- Warns about units without adequate maintenance
- Applies penalties to unsupplied units

## ðŸ“Š Testing Status
- All unit files load correctly with new cost structure
- Resource deduction system verified functional
- UI integration tested and working
- Maintenance system processes correctly
- All 11 required resources confirmed in active use

## ðŸŽ® Player Experience
The system provides a rich strategic layer where players must:
- Balance unit recruitment with available resources
- Maintain supply lines to keep armies effective
- Make strategic choices between unit types
- Consider economic capacity when expanding forces
- Manage cultural resources for unit morale

This implementation successfully fulfills all requirements from the problem statement while maintaining game balance and providing an engaging strategic experience.
