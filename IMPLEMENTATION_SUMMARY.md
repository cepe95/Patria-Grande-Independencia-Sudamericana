# Unit Selection System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Objectives Achieved

The unit selection system has been successfully implemented according to all requirements in the problem statement:

### ‚úÖ Individual Selection
- Left-click on allied units selects them individually
- Previous selections are replaced by new ones
- Visual feedback shows selected state

### ‚úÖ Multiple Selection  
- Click and drag creates selection rectangle
- All allied units within rectangle are selected
- Visual rectangle shows during drag operation

### ‚úÖ Additive Selection
- Shift + click adds/removes units from selection
- Shift + drag adds rectangle contents to selection
- Proper toggle behavior for already selected units

### ‚úÖ Movement Orders
- Right-click orders selected units to move
- Multiple units form formation to avoid overlap
- Single units move directly to target

### ‚úÖ Deselection
- Click empty space clears all selections
- Only works when not dragging (proper gesture detection)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
1. **SelectionManager** - Singleton handling all selection logic
2. **SelectionRectangle** - Visual component for drag selection
3. **UnitInstance** - Enhanced with selection support
4. **StrategicMap** - Integrated input handling

### Key Features
- **Faction Filtering**: Only Patriot units selectable
- **Coordinate Conversion**: Screen-to-world space handling
- **Formation Movement**: Circular arrangement for multi-unit orders
- **Visual Feedback**: Color tinting and outline effects
- **Debug Interface**: Real-time selection status display

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified/Created
- `Systems/SelectionManager.gd` - Core selection logic
- `Scripts/UI/SelectionRectangle.gd` - Visual rectangle
- `Scripts/Strategic/StrategicMap.gd` - Input handling integration
- `Scripts/Strategic/UnitInstance.gd` - Selection state support
- `Scripts/Data/UnitData.gd` - Added faction and velocity
- `project.godot` - Added autoload and input actions

### Input Actions
- **ui_shift** - Additive selection modifier
- Mouse clicks and drags handled through input events

### Visual Effects
- Blue tint for selected units
- White outline effect
- Semi-transparent selection rectangle
- On-screen selection counter

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Tests
- `Scripts/Tests/SelectionSystemTest.gd` - Validation script
- Checks for all required methods and singletons
- Provides manual testing functions

### Test Units
- 5 sample units created automatically
- Positioned for easy testing of selection features
- Proper faction assignment for testing

### Debug Features
- Comprehensive console logging
- On-screen selection status
- Coordinate conversion logging
- Movement command feedback

## üìñ Documentation

### User Guide
- `SELECTION_SYSTEM.md` - Complete usage instructions
- Control reference and feature overview
- Technical implementation details

### Validation
- `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Requirements verification

## üöÄ Usage

### For Players
1. Start the game and navigate to strategic map
2. Use mouse controls as documented
3. Visual feedback confirms all actions
4. On-screen display shows current selection

### For Developers
1. SelectionManager provides clean API
2. All methods are properly documented
3. Debug output helps troubleshooting
4. Test script validates functionality

## ‚ú® Extras

Beyond the basic requirements, the implementation includes:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Fallback systems for edge cases
- Performance-optimized coordinate conversion
- Clean separation of concerns
- Extensible architecture for future features

The system seamlessly integrates with the existing game architecture while providing all requested functionality.
