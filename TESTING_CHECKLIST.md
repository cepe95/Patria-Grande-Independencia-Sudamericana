## Debug Information

### Console Output to Check
- "‚úì MainHUD inicializado"
- "‚úì Sistema de combate inicializado" 
- "‚öî Iniciando combate: [Unit1] vs [Unit2]"
- "üí• Turno X: [results]"
- "üèÅ Combate terminado: [winner]"

### UI Elements to Verify
- Combat panel appears centered on screen
- Unit icons load correctly (Patriota/Realista)
- Stats update in real-time during combat
- Combat log scrolls automatically
- Buttons respond correctly

### Integration Points to Test
- Strategic map combat detection
- HUD event logging
- Unit data modifications
- Division instance movement callbacks

## Known Limitations
- Combat only triggers on unit movement completion
- Distance threshold is 50 pixels (may need adjustment)
- No terrain modifiers implemented yet
- Combat interface may need UI polish

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ All test cases pass without errors
‚úÖ Combat logic produces reasonable results
‚úÖ UI is responsive and informative
‚úÖ Events are properly logged
‚úÖ System integrates seamlessly with existing game

## Troubleshooting

### If Combat Doesn't Trigger:
- Check that units are from different factions
- Verify units are close enough (< 50 pixels)
- Ensure units have troops (cantidad_total > 0)
- Check console for error messages

### If UI Doesn't Appear:
- Verify CombatPanel.tscn is properly referenced in MainHUD.tscn
- Check that CombatUI node exists in scene tree
- Ensure no script errors in console

### If Combat Logic Fails:
- Check DivisionData has all required fields
- Verify faction names match exactly ("Patriota", "Realista")
- Ensure units are in "activo" state
